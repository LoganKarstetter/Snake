# Snake
A single-player Snake game I created in late January/early February of 2018. The snake's movement is controlled with the up, down, left, and right arrow keys. Pressing the ESC key will exit the game. A single command line argument (integer value) can be passed to set the FPS for the game (it runs at 6 FPS by default). All the game's artwork was created by me and can be found under Snake/src/Images if you wish to view/edit it.
