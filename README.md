# Snake
A Snake game I created in Java in late January and early February of 2018. The game features custom artwork, an animation framework, active rendering, double buffering, and will accept a single integer command line argument to set the desired FPS (6 by default, higher values will be a challenge). The snake’s movement is controlled with the arrow keys and the ESC key will quit the game. If you need a break you can also take focus away from the window to pause the game. Try to eat as many apples as you can! Good luck!

Note: All of the game’s artwork was created by me and can be found under Snake/src/Images if you wish to view or edit my masterpieces.
